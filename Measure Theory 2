\begin{lem} 
	If $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\sigma(\mathcal{F})$,then $\sigma(\mathcal{A})\subseteq\sigma(\mathcal{F})$.

\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	$\sigma(\mathcal{A})$ denotes the intersection of sigma-algebras containing $ \mathcal{A} $. Since $\sigma(\mathcal{F})$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing $ \mathcal{A} $, $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$is contained in $\sigma(\mathcal{F})  $. Thus $\sigma(\mathcal{A})\subseteq\sigma(\mathcal{F})$.
\end{proof}
\begin{defn}
	Let $ (X,\mathcal{T}) $ be a topological space. Then the $sigma $-Algbera generated by all open sets is called the "Borel $\sigma$-Algebra" on $ (X,\mathcal{T}) $ and is denoted by $ \mathcal{B}_x $.The members of $\mathcal{B}_x $ are called Borel Sets.
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
\begin{enumerate}
		$\mathcal{B}_x $ thus includes open sets,closed sets,countable intersections of open sets,countable intersection of closed sets and so forth.
\end{enumerate}
\end{note}
\begin{defn}
	A countable intersection of open sets is called a $ G_\delta$ set.A countable union of closed sets is called an $ F_\sigma $ set. A countable union of $ G_delta$ sets is called $ G_{\delta \sigma}$ set and finally a countable intersection of $F _\sigma $ sets is called an $ F_{\sigma \delta}$ set.
\end{defn}
\begin{exmp}
	Let X be a non-empty set.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $ \mathcal{P}(X) $ is $ \sigma $-algebra.
		\item $ \mathcal{A}=\{X,\emptyset\} $ is the smallest $\sigma$-algbera on X and is called trivial $\sigma$-algebra.
		\item $ \mathcal{A}=\{A\subseteq X \mid A\;or \;X \setminus A\;is\;countable\} $ is a $\sigma$-algebra and is called "countbale cocountable sigma $\sigma$-algebra".It is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing all singletons.Hence $\{x\}\in \mathcal{A}\;,\forall x\in X$.
		\begin{proof}
			By definition a cocountable subset of X is a subset Y whose complement in X is a countbale set.The set of all subsets of X which are either countbale or cocountbale form a "countbale cocountable sigma $\sigma$-algebra".\newline
			Since $\emptyset$ is countbale, $\emptyset \in \mathcal{A}$. By definition ,if $A\in\mathcal{A}$, then either A or $A^c$ is countable.If A is countable, then $A^c$ is cocountable and vice versa. Hence for both cases, we have $A^c \in \mathcal{A}$. Thus $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under complementation.\newline
			Let $\{A_j\;\mid\;j\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathcal{A}$. Let A=$\bigcup_{j\in\mathbb{N}} A_j$.The sets $A_j$ may be countable or coucountable.We need to show $A\in\mathcal{A}$.Let us counsider 2 cases.\newline
			\textbf{Case 1:} $A_j$ is countbale $\forall\;j\in\mathbb{N}$.Since the countable union of countable sets is also countable, thus $A\in\mathcal{A}$.\newline
			\textbf{Case 2:} Let us consider, there exists some $j\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $A_j$ is cocountable. Now $A_j\subseteq A$. Hence $A^c \subseteq A_j{^c}$ . Since the set A is cocountbale, the set $A^c$ is countable. Hence the set A is cocountable. So A$\in\mathcal{A}$. Thus the set $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under complements and countbale unions and is a $\sigma$-algebra.\newline
			\textbf{For the second part of the proof}, we will show that $\mathcal{A}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by all singletons of X. Let $\mathcal{N}$ denote the $\sigma$-algebra generated by all singletons of X. We need to show $\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{A}$.\newline
			By our assumption, $\mathcal{N}$ is smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing all singeltons. Since each singleton is coutnable, $\mathcal{N} \subseteq \mathcal{A}$.\newline
			Let $P\subseteq X$ and without any loss of generality, we can assume that P is a non-empty set. If P is countable, then P can be written as a countable union of all its singletons. Each of these singletons is an element in $\mathcal{N}$.Thus $P\in\mathcal{N}$. Since the choice of P was arbitrary, $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{N}$.\newline
			If P is cocountable, then $P^c$ is countable, hence $P^c\in\mathcal{N}$.Again, $\mathcal{N}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, so.So $P\in\mathcal{N}$. Hence $P\in\mathcal{N}$ and so we can infer that  $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{N}$.\newline
			Thus we have shown that $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{N} \subseteq \mathcal{A}$. Hence $\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{A}$.
			
			
			
		\end{proof}
		\item The "Borel $\sigma$-Algebra" on $\Real$ in usual topology is denoted by $\mathcal{B}_\Real$.
		\begin{prop}
			The $\sigma$-Algebra  denoted by $\mathcal{B}_\Real$ on $\Real$ (in ususal topology) is generated by each of the following:\newline
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Open intervals denoted by $\zeta_1=\{(a,b)\:\mid\:a<b\}$.
				\item Closed intervals denoted by $\zeta_2=\{[a,b]\:\mid\:a<b\}$.
				\item Half-Open intervals denoted by $\zeta_3=\{(a,b]\:\mid\:a<b\}\:and\: \zeta_4=\{[a,b)\:\mid\:a<b\}$.
				\item Open Rays denoted by $\zeta_5=\{(a,\infty)\}\:and\:\zeta_6=\{(-\infty,a)\}$.
				\item Open Rays denoted by $\zeta_7=\{[a,\infty)\}\:and\:\zeta_8=\{(-\infty,a]\}$.
			\end{itemize}
			
		\end{prop}
	\end{enumerate}
