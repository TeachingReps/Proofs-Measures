\section{The Order Topology}
If X is a simply ordered set, there is a standard topology for X, defined using the order relation. It is called "Order Topology".\\
\begin{flushleft}
{\bf Definition}: Suppose X is a set having order relation $<$. Given a$<$b $\epsilon$ X, there are four subsets of X called intervals determined by a and b. They are as follows :\\
$(a,b)=\{x\mid a<x<b\}$\\
$(a,b]=\{x\mid a<x\leq b\}$\\
$[a,b)=\{x\mid a\leq x<b\}$\\
$[a,b]=\{x\mid a\leq x\leq b\}$\\
\vspace{2mm}
{\bf Definition}: Let X be a simple order relation.Assume that X has more than one element.Let $\mathbb{B}$ be the collection of all sets of the following types:\\
\vspace{2mm}
{\bf 1}.All open intervals (a,b) in X.\\
{\bf 2}.All intervals of the form [$a_0$,b), where $a_0$ is the smallest element (if any) of X.\\
{\bf 3}.All intervals of the form (a,$b_0$], where $b_0$ is the largest element (if any) of X.\\
\vspace{2mm}
The collection $\mathbb{B}$ is a basis for a topology on X, which is called the order topology.\\
\vspace{1mm}
{\bf Remark}: If X has no smallest then there are no sets of type {\bf 2} and if X has no largest element then there are no sets of type {\bf 3}.
